<p style= "font-family:arial;line-height:1.6"><b><font size='5'>Renewable</font> </b> <font size="+1"> <br>  This means that the power produced cannot be depleted since hydropower uses water; <br> a natural resource from the earth which can be recycled to generate electricity.</p>

<p style= "font-family:arial;line-height:1.6"><b><font size="5">Reduces Greenhouse Gas Emissions</font> </b> <br> As electricity is generated, greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide are not released, <br> hence, it does not cause air pollution. In succession, this aids in the prevention of global warming and climate change.</p>

<p style= "font-family:arial;line-height:1.6"><b><font size='5'>Promoties Irrigation</font> </b> <br> The lake water that is formed behind the dam can be useful <br> in crop production for local farmers.</p>

<p style= "font-family:arial;line-height:1.6"><b><font size="5">Non-toxic</font> </b> <br>  Compared to fossil fuels, biomass and nuclear power, <br> there is no fuel involved in hydropower, making it less harmful.</p>

<p style= "font-family:arial;line-height:1.6"><b><font size="5">Readily Available</font> </b> <br>   Once electricity is not required and water builds up, <br> the dam can be sealed to stop the production of electricity so that the energy can be stored until it is eventually needed.</p>

<p style= "font-family:arial;line-height:1.6"><b><font size='5'>Flooding</font> </b> <br> When the dam is constructed on highland, there is risk of flooding which can put the livelihoods of persons in danger forcing them to relocate if there is no alternative.</p>

<p style= "font-family:arial;line-height:1.6"><b><font size='5'>Deterioration of Plant and Animal Wildlife and Habitats</font> </b> <br>  Marine life can be trapped from reaching their breathing ground due to the blockage of water by the dam disabling access to food.</p>

<p style= "font-family:arial;line-height:1.6"><b><font size='5'>Obstructs Road Access and Power Lines</font> </b> <br>  Dam built may intervene in the construction of infrastructure such as roads and power lines.</p> 

<p style= "font-family:arial;line-height:1.6"><b><font size='5'>Drought-Influenced</font> </b> <br>  As energy produced is directly related to the availability of water, a drought can reduce the amount of electricity generated due to less supply of water.</p>

<p style= "font-family:arial;line-height:1.6"><b><font size='5'>Expensive and Time-consuming to Construct</font> </b> <br> Dams are generally expensive build especially to be able to meet the optimal standards in order to function efficiently.</p>
